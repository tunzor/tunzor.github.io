      <description>Hugo, I just recently discovered, is one of many static site generators. You feed them content in the form of Markdown files and they spit out HTML pages which you can then provide to a web server for hosting.
This in and of itself might not be very interesting but the potential hosting environments are what particularly interest me.
Why go static? Since the pages are HTML, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about having a server dynamically render a page when a user makes a request to your site.</description>
