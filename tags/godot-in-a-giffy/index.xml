      <description>As outlined in a previous post, I started developing a game with the Godot engine about catching falling food and serving it to demanding customers, aptly named Diner Drop.
In this series of posts I intend on showcasing the progress made on the game&amp;rsquo;s development through the greatest of all Internet formats: the gif. A lot can be said with pictures (especially moving ones) but I may also include a few words too.</description>
