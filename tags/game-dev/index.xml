      <description>Like a lot of other developers, and even regular folks, I enjoy video games. If you had a nickel for every time you heard or read that somewhere, you&amp;rsquo;d probably be too rich to be reading this blog; instead enjoying your private island complete with whatever else rich people buy.
I&amp;rsquo;ll save you the rest of the cliched prose that usually follows that line and just say that I also enjoy learning about the process of, and actually, making games.</description>
