      <description>Following up the post I wrote about making a game in one day with this one may seem like a step back, going from 22 to 48 hours.
The difference is there&amp;rsquo;s no qualification of development time vs actual time passed; this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the luxury of spreading my development over 4 days.
2 days. 48 hours.
That&amp;rsquo;s all the time I had to think, plan, and develop. Not to mention also eat, sleep, and tend to other normal bodily functions.</description>
