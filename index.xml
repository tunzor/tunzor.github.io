      <title>My Hobby: Game Dev - A History</title>

      <description>Like a lot of other developers, and even regular folks, I enjoy video games. If you had a nickel for every time you heard or read that somewhere, you&amp;rsquo;d probably be too rich to be reading this blog; instead enjoying your private island complete with whatever else rich people buy.
I&amp;rsquo;ll save you the rest of the cliched prose that usually follows that line and just say that I also enjoy learning about the process of, and actually, making games.</description>

      <title>Printing Jenkins credential values to the log</title>

      <description>The below is part of a screenplay I&amp;rsquo;m working on for a sequel in the Speed franchise, tentatively called Speed 3: Push IT. It also nicely sets up a scenario for the later bit about viewing Jenkins credentials in plaintext.
If you&amp;rsquo;d rather not read it, just scroll on down. I won&amp;rsquo;t be too hurt.

      <title>Automating the publication of a Hugo generated site with Google Cloud Build</title>
      <link>https://tunzor.github.io/posts/cloud-build-hugo-site/</link>

      <description>Hugo is a really cool tool for getting a blog up and running quickly.
In a previous post I outlined how to use it to generate a site and then host that site on Github Pages or Google Cloud Storage. Now I want to take it a step further and automate its publication on Github Pages. Why? Cause I&amp;rsquo;m lazy, automation is cool, and doing so will make us look better in the optical sensors of our eventual robot overlords.</description>

      <title>DevOps Tools 101 - Kubernetes</title>

      <description>DevOps Tools 101 is a series of posts outlining in easy to digest form, the tools available and in use by the DevOps community.
Today we&amp;rsquo;ll be learning about Kubernetes (often abbreviated to k8s), which was originally developed and then open-sourced by Google.
The Official Description From kubernetes.io
 Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

      <title>Quick Tip: List docker images sorted by size</title>

      <description>The docker image ls command has an option for filtering output but what if we want to sort the images to find the really hefty ones? You know, the ones that might need to go the way of Old Yeller.
Huh? What&amp;rsquo;s that, docker? You can&amp;rsquo;t do that.
If you want something done right&amp;hellip;
It ain&amp;rsquo;t pretty but it works.
docker image ls --format &amp;quot;{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}} {{.Size}}&amp;quot; | \ awk &#39;{if ($2~/GB/) print substr($2, 1, length($2)-2) * 1000 &amp;quot;MB - &amp;quot; $1 ; else print $2 &amp;quot; - &amp;quot; $1 }&#39; | \ sed &#39;/^0/d&#39; | \ sort -n   Side Note</description>

      <title>Deploying a dockerized two-tier app on Kubernetes</title>

      <description>For a great deal of developers, myself included, doing something is the preferred method of learning as opposed to reading how to do it. When I was wrapping my head around using kubernetes to manage my docker containers, I found that creating a deployment from scratch was invaluable. I&amp;rsquo;d like to walk you through that deployment and explain everything along the way.
Before we jump in, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to have:</description>

      <title>Quick Tip: Make a directory and enter it with one command</title>
      <link>https://tunzor.github.io/posts/mkdir-and-enter-one-liner/</link>

      <guid>https://tunzor.github.io/posts/mkdir-and-enter-one-liner/</guid>
      <description>We all make directories. It&amp;rsquo;s one way that we attempt to bring order to the chaos that is the filesystem.
We&amp;rsquo;re also pretty lazy. Creating a new directory and navigating into it is usually a two command affair:
mkdir order-i-say cd order-i-say  Not anymore it isn&amp;rsquo;t:
mkdir quickly-now &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd $_   Explanation
$_ is the last argument passed to the previous command. In our case, it&amp;rsquo;s the directory name.</description>

      <title>Running a Hugo generated site on Github Pages and Google Cloud Storage</title>

      <description>Hugo, I just recently discovered, is one of many static site generators. You feed them content in the form of Markdown files and they spit out HTML pages which you can then provide to a web server for hosting.
This in and of itself might not be very interesting but the potential hosting environments are what particularly interest me.
Why go static? Since the pages are HTML, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about having a server dynamically render a page when a user makes a request to your site.</description>
